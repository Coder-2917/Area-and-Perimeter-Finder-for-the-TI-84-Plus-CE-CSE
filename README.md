# Area/Perimeter Finder for the TI-84 Plus CE
This TI-BASIC program will find the area and perimeter of the supported shapes.
  As of now, supported shapes include:
    -Square
    -Rectangle
    -Triangle
    -Circle
    -Trapezoid

You will also need NODONE.8xp to run this program.
If your OS is 5.5.1 or later (TI-84 Plus CE), you will need [arTIfiCE](https://yvantt.github.io/arTIfiCE/), because NODONE is an assembly program written in eZ80 ASM.
